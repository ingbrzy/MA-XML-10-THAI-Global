    <string name="wifi_call_available_message">"WiFi Calling is a service of your mobile operator, Orange Polska S.A.
Please read the description of the service provided by your operator:

WiFi Calling service enables you to make and receive voice calls over any WiFi internet connection, even in a situation where you are outside any mobile network’s coverage. Once the service is active for your mobile number, every time you connect to a WiFi network, your voice calls will be performed using WiFi Calling. This will be presented to you by a dedicated icon on the notification bar.

In the case your WiFi connection is of poor quality or your device is outside a WiFi network’s coverage, your phone will make calls using an available mobile network.

Your calls made with WiFi Calling in Poland are charged in the same way as your regular mobile calls in your mobile tariff plan. Incoming calls in Poland are free of charge. If you make WiFi Calling calls outside Poland your calls may be charged with a dedicated price specified in your mobile tariff plan’s price list.

Notwithstanding, your WiFi connections may be charged independently by the provider of your WiFi connection.

Once you press the ACCEPT button and your phone connects to a WiFi network, your WiFi Calling service will be activated. You can disable the WiFi Calling at any time using the phone menu.
